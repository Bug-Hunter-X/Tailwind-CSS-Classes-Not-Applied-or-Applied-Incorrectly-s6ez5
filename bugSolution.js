// Check for typos in class names.
// Ensure correct class order (sometimes important for specificity).
// Verify that `tailwind.config.js` is properly configured and includes all necessary plugins and configurations.
// Check for CSS conflicts by inspecting the browser's developer tools to determine if styles are being overridden.
// Review purging configuration (if using) to ensure that necessary classes are not being removed.
